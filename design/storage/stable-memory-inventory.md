# Stable-memory inventory

Last updated: 2026-06-23
Status: Implemented (graph: sequential LARA MemoryIds 0–31 + facade 32–44 = 45 regions, incl. ADR 0030 unique-effect outbox + slice-10 shard-local unique values + ADR 0031 canonical vertex embeddings; router repack ADR 0011/0018/0019 + ADR 0030 constraint catalog + reservation table + slice-6 reverse index + pending-effect discovery index + ADR 0031 Slice 3 embedding-name catalog + vector-index definition catalog = 43 regions, 0–42; graph-vector-index: ADR 0031 Slice 2 = 11 regions, 0–10)
Anchor timestamp: 2026-06-23 22:55:58 UTC +0000

Layout change policy: [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-stable-memory-layout.md).

## Purpose

Single inventory of stable-memory regions and heap-only facade state for the graph, router, graph-index, and graph-vector-index canisters. Each row names the owning domain, classification, and rebuild path where one exists.

Code source of truth for runtime `MemoryId` constants:

- `crates/graph/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`
- `crates/router/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`
- `crates/graph-index/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`
- `crates/graph-vector-index/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`

Typed layout registry (descriptive mirror + validation tests): `gleaph_graph_kernel::stable_layout`
and per-canister `facade/stable/layout.rs` — [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-stable-memory-layout.md) §7.

Thread-local pairing: `facade/stable.rs` in each crate.

### Region-count doc-sync checklist

Region counts and per-region classes in this document mirror the typed registry, which is the
mechanical source of truth. The registry tests enforce the counts below; when they change, update
this document and [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-stable-memory-layout.md) in the same patch:

| Canister | Regions | Id range | Registry constant + test |
|----------|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| Graph | 45 | 0–44 | `GRAPH_STABLE_LAYOUT` — `graph_layout_registry_matches_baseline` |
| Router | 43 | 0–42 | `ROUTER_STABLE_LAYOUT` — `router_layout_registry_matches_baseline` |
| Graph-index | 7 | 0–6 | `INDEX_STABLE_LAYOUT` — `index_layout_registry_matches_baseline` |
| Graph-vector-index | 11 | 0–10 | `VECTOR_INDEX_STABLE_LAYOUT` — `vector_index_layout_registry_matches_baseline` |

The canonical/derived split for the router registry projections is pinned by
`router_registry_canonical_derived_split_matches_inventory`.

## Classifications

Authoritative definitions and Gleaph examples: `gleaph_graph_kernel::stable_layout::StableMemoryClass`
(rustdoc on each variant). Per-region class and functional role: `GRAPH_STABLE_LAYOUT`,
`ROUTER_STABLE_LAYOUT`, `INDEX_STABLE_LAYOUT`.

| Class | Meaning | Examples in this repo |
|-------|---------|------------------------|
| `canonical` | Authoritative facts; system meaning does not depend on derived stores | Forward LARA CSR/payloads; vertex/edge properties; router registry and catalogs; mutation idempotency |
| `derived` | Projection or mirror rebuildable from canonical state | Reverse LARA; edge aliases/equality postings; graph-index postings |
| `maintenance` | Physical or admin bookkeeping; not query truth | LARA free spans; maintenance queue; router backfill cursors |
| `catalog` | Bidirectional name ↔ id maps (`BidirectionalCatalog`) | Router label/property/graph/index-name resolution pairs |
| `telemetry` | Event-sourced label stats and projection adjuncts | Graph label stats delta log; router label stats and `ROUTER_LABEL_STATS_PROJECTION` |
| `compatibility` | Legacy read view; another store owns new writes | *(none — P1 `EDGE_WEIGHT_PROFILES` retired 2026-06-12)* |
| `ephemeral` | Heap-only; no `MemoryId` — **not in layout registry** | Graph `PENDING` queues; router planner catalog |

**Sync co-update:** Some derived stores are updated in the same mutation as their canonical source (no async lag). They still have a separate physical region and are classified `derived`.

**Query semantics when derived state lags:** [derived-state-query-semantics.md](../index/derived-state-query-semantics.md).

## Derived-state rebuild summary

| Derived store | Canonical source | Update path | Rebuild / backfill |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| LARA reverse orientation | Forward edges + payloads | Co-updated on edge insert/delete | **Implemented:** `check_reverse_adjacency` + `rebuild_reverse_adjacency` (`facade/derived_state/reverse_adjacency.rs`). The rebuild is a **differential** per-diverged-key reconcile (ADR 0026), not a full clear-and-rebuild — a full rebuild would reassign reverse slot indices, cascade-invalidating `EDGE_ALIASES` keys + reverse payload sidecars. |
| Edge aliases | Forward/reverse adjacency in `GRAPH` | Sync: `commit_insert_edge_alias` on edge insert | **Implemented:** `check_edge_aliases` + `rebuild_edge_aliases` (`facade/derived_state/edge_alias.rs`) |
| Edge property postings (graph-index) | `EDGE_PROPERTIES` (registered props) | DML + `edge_pending` flush | **Implemented:** `backfill_edge_property_postings` + router `admin_edge_backfill_step` ([ADR 0009](../adr/0009-edge-property-index-and-index-ddl.md); retired shard-local `EDGE_EQUALITY_POSTINGS` 2026-06-12) |
| Vertex property postings (graph-index) | Vertex properties (indexable) | DML + `pending.rs` flush | **Implemented:** `backfill_vertex_property_postings` + router `admin_vertex_property_backfill_step` |
| Label postings (graph-index) | `VertexLabelStore` | DML + `label_pending` flush | **Implemented:** `backfill_label_postings` + router `admin_label_backfill_step` ([label-index.md](../index/label-index.md)) |
| Vector-index entries (graph-vector-index) | `VERTEX_EMBEDDINGS` (canonical embeddings) | DML + `vector_pending` flush | **Slice 2:** `backfill_vertex_embeddings` (mutation path + repair drain); router admin step deferred to Slice 3 ([vector-index.md](../index/vector-index.md), [ADR 0031](../adr/0031-vertex-embedding-store-and-derived-vector-index.md)) |
| Router label stats projection | Graph `LabelStatsDelta` | `advance_label_stats_projection` + per-shard cursor | **Implemented:** graph delta log replay via `admin_label_stats_projection_step`; no full historical scan |
| Router indexed-property catalog | Property catalog + planner stats | Planner registration | **Stable** — row layout MemoryId 18–19 |

## Graph canister — facade regions

Repacked 2026-06-11. **Removed:** property name catalog, `VERTEX_LOGICAL_IDS`, federation remote-ref stable (`REMOTE_VERTEX_REFS`, `REMOTE_FORWARD_IN`), `PEER_GRAPH_CANISTERS`. LARA ids are consecutive **0–31**; facade starts at **32**.

| MemoryId | Symbol | Thread-local | Init fn | Class | Owner domain | Rebuild |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------|-------|--------------|---------|
| 32 | `VERTEX_LABEL_SETS` | `VERTEX_LABELS` | `init_vertex_label_store` | canonical | labels | — |
| 33 | `VERTEX_PROPERTIES` | `VERTEX_PROPERTIES` | `init_vertex_property_store` | canonical | properties | — |
| 34 | `EDGE_PROPERTIES` | `EDGE_PROPERTIES` | `init_edge_property_store` | canonical | properties | — |
| 35 | `EDGE_ALIASES` | `EDGE_ALIASES` | `init_edge_alias_index` | derived | adjacency | `check_edge_aliases` / `rebuild_edge_aliases` |
| 36 | `GRAPH_METADATA` | `METADATA` | `init_metadata` | canonical | federation metadata | — |
| 37 | `LABEL_STATS_DELTA_SEQ` | `LABEL_STATS_DELTA_SEQ` | `init_label_stats_delta_seq` | telemetry | label stats projection | Monotonic seq allocator |
| 38 | `LABEL_STATS_DELTA_LOG` | `LABEL_STATS_DELTA_LOG` | `init_label_stats_delta_log` | telemetry | label stats projection | Delta replay to router |
| 39 | `GRAPH_MUTATION_JOURNAL` | `GRAPH_MUTATION_JOURNAL` | `init_graph_mutation_journal` | canonical | idempotency | Mutation outcome + emitted delta seq range. A single-DML mutation is recorded `Completed` even when its index flush is deferred to the repair journal (region 41), since the store mutation + deltas are durable and the index converges async (ADR 0024). Bounded by [ADR 0027](../adr/0027-graph-mutation-journal-retention.md): every entry carries `recorded_at_ns` and is evicted after `GRAPH_MUTATION_JOURNAL_RETENTION_NS` (9d, a lower bound `>=` the router's 7d replay TTL — see region 7) via amortized write-path GC (**B**, heap round-robin cursor) on the completed-journal write. Legacy entries (`recorded_at_ns == None`) are lazy-stamped to "now" on first sweep so the pre-upgrade backlog ages out from upgrade time. Ack-through-seq is **not** used as the eviction trigger (unsound: no-delta mutations, shard-global cursor, ack precedes router completion) |
| 40 | `PENDING_VERTEX_PURGES` | `PENDING_VERTEX_PURGES` | `init_pending_vertex_purges` | maintenance | vertex delete | Tombstoned vertices mid-purge (ADR 0021); insert is fail-closed and runs before the tombstone (a failed insert aborts the delete, never leaving ungated ghost edges); rebuildable by scanning tombstoned vertices with surviving incident edges (no API) |
| 41 | `INDEX_REPAIR_JOURNAL` | `INDEX_REPAIR_JOURNAL` | `init_index_repair_journal` | maintenance | federated index repair | Failed-flush index postings persisted on compensation-success (ADR 0023 D5); re-applied by the maintenance driver each tick and on `post_upgrade`, removed on success. Value type is `RepairJournalEntry { mutation_id, op }` (ADR 0029 Phase 2): each entry carries the originating federated `mutation_id` (`0` = untracked sentinel) so `index_pending_min_mutation_id()` derives the mutation-linked index watermark (smallest unapplied tracked mutation). **Backward-incompatible repack**: the value schema changed in place from a bare `RepairPostingOp` to `RepairJournalEntry`; pre-existing entries in the old layout are not migrated (no production deployment) |
| 42 | `UNIQUE_EFFECT_OUTBOX` | `UNIQUE_EFFECT_OUTBOX` | `init_unique_effect_outbox` | canonical | cross-shard uniqueness | **`EffectId { mutation_id, effect_ordinal } → UniqueEffectReceipt { claim_id?, owner_element_id, constraint_id, encoded_value, op: Acquire \| Release }`** (ADR 0030). Pinned commit evidence: each unique-affecting canonical segment appends one receipt per effect; an effect stays pinned until the Router acks its `EffectId` (per-effect, never unpinning a sibling). Canonical: a `Reserved`-not-yet-committed claim has no receipt, so un-acked-effect *absence* is authoritative proof of non-commit — decoupled from the 9-day journal eviction (region 39 / ADR 0027). Replicated `Acquire`-by-`ClaimId` proof read + per-effect ack are Router-only update endpoints. Append is idempotent across deterministic replays. Emit wiring into the DML segment lands in slice 5 |
| 43 | `GRAPH_LOCAL_UNIQUE_VALUES` | `GRAPH_LOCAL_UNIQUE_VALUES` | `init_graph_local_unique_table` | canonical | shard-local global uniqueness | **`(constraint_id, encoded_value) → LocalUniqueRecord { owner_element_id }`** (ADR 0030 slice 10). Canonical source of truth for `ShardLocalGlobal` unique constraints: a graph proven single-shard at CREATE enforces graph-wide uniqueness entirely in its one owning shard's local table, bypassing the Router reservation/`UNIQUE_EFFECT_OUTBOX` path. The acquire path preflights all claims and inserts them inside the canonical write segment (all-or-nothing); a delete/remove frees the value by owner match; the DROP drain purges the constraint's entries and gates `Removed` on the range being empty. The key omits `graph_id` because one graph canister hosts exactly one graph/shard. No `Acquire`/`Release` receipts and no Router reservations are ever written for these constraints |
| 44 | `VERTEX_EMBEDDINGS` | `VERTEX_EMBEDDINGS` | `init_vertex_embedding_store` | canonical | embeddings | **`(VertexId, EmbeddingNameId) → StoredEmbedding { encoding, dims, version, bytes }`** ([ADR 0031](../adr/0031-vertex-embedding-store-and-derived-vector-index.md)). Canonical fixed-dimension `F32` vertex embeddings owned by the graph shard. Vertex-major, big-endian, fixed-width 6-byte key so vertex delete enumerates a vertex's embeddings via a per-vertex range scan (`commit_clear_vertex_embeddings`). Value is a length-prefixed manual layout led by a `schema_version: u8` tag; an unknown schema/encoding tag traps on read (incompatible layout requires a migration). Source for future derived vector-index backfill; the derived index and Router query path are not implemented yet |

Graph facade **45 regions** total (32 LARA + 13 facade). Retired 2026-06-12: `EDGE_PAYLOAD_PROFILES` → router SSOT ([ADR 0008](../adr/0008-edge-payload-profile-router-ssot.md)); `EDGE_EQUALITY_POSTINGS` → graph-index ([ADR 0009](../adr/0009-edge-property-index-and-index-ddl.md)).

Property **names** are router-owned (`ROUTER_PROPERTY_CATALOG`); graph stores values by `PropertyId` only.

### Graph ephemeral (not in `memory.rs`)

|--------|----------|------|-----------------|
| `PENDING` (property postings) | `graph/src/index/pending.rs` | Queued property index ops | In-flight batch lost on upgrade; failed batches persist to `INDEX_REPAIR_JOURNAL` (ADR 0023 D5); `backfill_vertex_property_postings` covers historical vertex properties |
| `PENDING` (edge postings) | `graph/src/index/edge_pending.rs` | Queued edge property index ops | In-flight batch lost on upgrade; failed batches persist to `INDEX_REPAIR_JOURNAL` (ADR 0023 D5); `backfill_edge_property_postings` covers historical edge properties |

## Router canister — stable regions

Repacked 2026-06-17: placement removed, controllers merged into auth, MemoryIds compacted to **0–33** (34 regions). ADR 0030 appended the uniqueness constraint catalog (**34–36**), the uniqueness reservation table (**37**), and the slice-6 reservation reverse index (**38**) and pending unique-effect discovery index (**39**), bringing the total to 40 regions (0–39). ADR 0031 Slice 3 appended the graph-scoped embedding-name catalog (**40–41**) and the derived vector-index definition catalog (**42**), bringing the total to **43 regions (0–42)**. Regions grouped **auth → registry → runtime config → idempotency → catalog → telemetry → maintenance → constraint catalog → reservation table → reservation reverse index → pending-effect discovery → embedding-name catalog → vector-index catalog**. `ROUTER_GRAPHS` keyed by **`GraphId`**; `ShardRegistryEntry` stores **`graph_id: GraphId`**. `ROUTER_SHARDS` keyed by **`GraphShardKey { graph_id, shard_id }`**; `ROUTER_SHARD_BY_GRAPH` is **`Principal → GraphShardKey`**; shard listing per logical graph uses **`ROUTER_SHARDS_BY_GRAPH_ID`**.

| MemoryId | Symbol | Thread-local | Init fn | Class | Owner domain | Rebuild |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------|-------|--------------|---------|
| 0 | `ROUTER_AUTH_PRINCIPAL_RECORDS` | `ROUTER_AUTH_STATE` | `init_auth_state` | canonical | auth | SSOT for router principal roles (`Role::Admin` for ops) |
| 1 | `ROUTER_GRAPHS` | `ROUTER_GRAPHS` | `init_graphs` | canonical | registry | **`BTreeMap<GraphId, GraphRegistryEntry>`** — graph registry SSOT |
| 2 | `ROUTER_SHARDS` | `ROUTER_SHARDS` | `init_shards` | canonical | registry | **`GraphShardKey → ShardRegistryEntry`** — shard dispatch SSOT ([ADR 0019](../adr/0019-graph-local-shard-id-and-index-clusters.md)) |
| 3 | `ROUTER_SHARD_BY_GRAPH` | `ROUTER_SHARD_BY_GRAPH` | `init_shard_by_graph` | derived index | registry | **`Principal → GraphShardKey`** — denormalized from `ROUTER_SHARDS`; commit-synced |
| 4 | `ROUTER_SHARDS_BY_GRAPH_ID` | `ROUTER_SHARDS_BY_GRAPH_ID` | `init_shards_by_graph_id` | derived index | registry | **`GraphId → Vec<ShardId>`** — denormalized fan-out index; commit-synced |
| 5 | `ROUTER_GRAPH_RUNTIME_CONFIG` | `ROUTER_GRAPH_RUNTIME_CONFIG` | `init_graph_runtime_config` | canonical | runtime config | `GraphId → GraphRuntimeConfig` (`element_id_encoding_key`, `index_group_size`, `index_cluster`; ADR 0019 S2b/S3) |

### Registry denormalization invariants (implemented 2026-06-17)

Regions **1–2** (canonical), **3–4** (derived indexes), **`ROUTER_GRAPH_RUNTIME_CONFIG` (5)**, plus **`ROUTER_GRAPH_CATALOG` (15–16)** form an intentional denormalized lookup set — not a merge candidate. Federation dispatch depends on all six staying synchronized at each registry **commit** boundary.

| Region | Class | Role in invariant |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| `ROUTER_GRAPH_CATALOG` | catalog (registry commit) | name ↔ `GraphId` |
| `ROUTER_GRAPHS` | canonical | `GraphId` → `GraphRegistryEntry` (RBAC, status, `is_home`) |
| `ROUTER_GRAPH_RUNTIME_CONFIG` | canonical | `GraphId` → `GraphRuntimeConfig` (encoding key, index cluster) |
| `ROUTER_SHARDS` | canonical | `GraphShardKey` → `ShardRegistryEntry` — dispatch SSOT |
| `ROUTER_SHARDS_BY_GRAPH_ID` | derived index | `GraphId` → `[ShardId]` — fan-out listing (shard ordinals graph-local) |
| `ROUTER_SHARD_BY_GRAPH` | derived index | `Principal` → `GraphShardKey` — graph canister uniqueness |

**Commit APIs** (`RouterStore::commit_register_graph`, `commit_register_shard`, `commit_unregister_shard` in `crates/router/src/facade/store/registry.rs`) update the affected regions atomically from the domain owner's perspective. **`commit_register_shard`** requires a matching `ROUTER_GRAPHS` entry (not catalog-only). **`check_registry_invariants`** (`registry_invariants.rs`) verifies full bidirectional consistency; unit tests call it after every registry mutation. Per-commit verification is disabled in production for cost (`verify_registry_invariants_after_commit` is a no-op outside tests), so the same read-only oracle is also exposed as the admin query **`admin_check_registry_invariants`** (`Role::Admin`) — used to confirm registry consistency on demand, including across a canister upgrade (the router has no upgrade hook and relies on stable memory surviving the reinstall). E2E coverage: `pocket-ic-tests/tests/router_registry_invariants.rs`. **`list_shards_for_graph_id`** / **`list_shards_for_graph`** walk `ROUTER_SHARDS_BY_GRAPH_ID` only (O(shards for graph)), hydrate **`Vec<ShardRegistryEntry>`** from `ROUTER_SHARDS`, and reject duplicate index ids and stale index→primary references; they do not full-scan `ROUTER_SHARDS` — missing index rows are caught on commit / by `check_registry_invariants`.

| 6 | `ROUTER_MUTATION_COUNTER` | `ROUTER_MUTATION_COUNTER` | `init_mutation_counter` | canonical | idempotency | — |
| 7 | `ROUTER_MUTATION_BY_CLIENT_KEY` | `ROUTER_MUTATION_BY_CLIENT_KEY` | `init_mutation_by_client_key` | canonical | idempotency | keys use **`graph_id: GraphId`**; bounded by [ADR 0025](../adr/0025-client-mutation-journal-retention-sweep.md): completed records are compacted (heavy fields dropped, **E**), and expired records (`created_at_ns` + `CLIENT_MUTATION_KEY_TTL_NS` 7d) are evicted automatically by amortized write-path GC (**B**, heap round-robin cursor) plus the operator backstop `admin_sweep_expired_client_mutation_keys`. `created_at_ns` is the sole age SSOT; GC cursor is ephemeral heap. [ADR 0029 Phase 4](../adr/0029-shard-local-atomicity-and-cross-canister-consistency.md): TTL eviction is now **terminal-only** (non-terminal sagas are retained as recovery targets); the record gained `routing_lease_ns: Option<u64>` (routing-lease reclaim) and `last_error: Option<String>` (recovery diagnostic), both Candid `opt` so pre-Phase-4 records decode as `None` with no migration |

| 31 | `ROUTER_LABEL_BACKFILL_STATE` | `ROUTER_LABEL_BACKFILL_STATE` | `init_label_backfill_state` | maintenance | label backfill | **`GraphShardKey → BackfillShardState`**, one entry per shard (bounded by live shard count, not operations); the step's TOCTOU concurrency guard is a heap-local `INFLIGHT_BACKFILL` claim set (not stable — auto-released on upgrade), so the stable record is unchanged; entry purged on `unregister_shard` so a re-registered shard does not inherit a stale cursor |
| 32 | `ROUTER_VERTEX_PROPERTY_BACKFILL_STATE` | `ROUTER_VERTEX_PROPERTY_BACKFILL_STATE` | `init_vertex_property_backfill_state` | maintenance | vertex property backfill | **`GraphShardKey → BackfillShardState`**; same heap-local claim guard and `unregister_shard` purge as region 31 |

| 36 | `ROUTER_UNIQUE_CONSTRAINTS` | `ROUTER_UNIQUE_CONSTRAINTS` | `init_unique_constraints` | catalog | constraint DDL metadata | **`(GraphId, ConstraintNameId) → ConstraintDefStableRecord::V1(ConstraintDefRecord { vertex_label_id, property_id, state: ConstraintLifecycle { Active \| Dropping }, dropping_at_ns, drop_scan_generation })`** — logical uniqueness constraint definitions, declare-on-empty (ADR 0030, first cut: vertex single-property). Versioned envelope (ADR 0030 Revision #18, Slice 9): the DROP lifecycle adds `state`/`dropping_at_ns`/`drop_scan_generation`; `Removed` is the terminal **absence** of the record (deleted by recovery once the completion gate holds), not a persisted enum value |
| 37 | `ROUTER_UNIQUE_RESERVATIONS` | `ROUTER_UNIQUE_RESERVATIONS` | `init_unique_reservations` | canonical | uniqueness reservation table | **`(GraphId, ConstraintNameId, encoded_value) → ReservationRecord { claim, state, reclaim_generation, owner_element_id, reserved_at_ns, proof_scope }`** — cross-shard uniqueness TCC claims (ADR 0030). Canonical: a `Reserved`-not-yet-`Committed` claim has no outbox receipt to rebuild from. Slice 3 implements the no-`await` Try; Confirm/Cancel + reclaim land in slices 4–6 |
| 38 | `ROUTER_MUTATION_RESERVATION_INDEX` | `ROUTER_MUTATION_RESERVATION_INDEX` | `init_mutation_reservation_index` | canonical | uniqueness reservation reverse index | **`MutationId → MutationReservationIndexEntry { client_key, nonterminal }`** — reverse index that resolves a reservation's claim (`MutationId`) to its owning `RouterMutationRecord` and GC-pins that record while non-terminal reservations remain (ADR 0030 slice 6). The row exists **iff** `nonterminal > 0`: `++` per fresh insert at Try, `--` on `FreshlyCommitted` Confirm and on reclaim Cancel; removed at zero |
| 39 | `ROUTER_UNIQUE_EFFECT_PENDING` | `ROUTER_UNIQUE_EFFECT_PENDING` | `init_unique_effect_pending` | canonical | pending unique-effect discovery index | **`(GraphId, MutationId, ShardId) → PendingEffectRecord { schema_version, canister, client_key, state: Active \| Quarantined, next_retry_ns, attempts, diagnostic? }`** — durable discovery source for Driver 2's unified effect recovery (ADR 0030 slice 6). Registered before the first dispatch `await` for any dispatch that may emit a unique `Acquire`/`Release`, so it co-commits with the reservation/envelope. The pinned `canister` is the row's immutable identity, stored verbatim (not re-derived from the shard registry) so recovery reaches the exact canister even after the shard is unregistered/reused; `register` is **fail-closed** (re-registering the same key to a different canister traps). `client_key` is the owning `ClientMutationKey`, stored so Driver 2 resolves the `RouterMutationRecord` (its terminal-completion proof) for **any** effect kind — a `Release` or orphan `Acquire` owns no reservation, so the reverse index (region 38) cannot resolve them; the row GC-pins that record while it exists. Driver 2 only drains a row once its mutation is terminal, classifies a reservation-less `Acquire` as an orphan only then, and removes the row only after a fresh `cursor=None` re-scan is empty. This is the only handle to an orphan `Acquire` whose reservation is gone (parked `Quarantined` on a long backoff, never acked). The value is a **versioned record** so the diagnostic/quarantine/backoff fields evolve without a breaking value-layout change. While any row remains the owning `RouterMutationRecord` is **GC-pinned** (Driver 2 reads its completion state); a row is removed only after the shard re-enumerates the mutation's effects empty (all acked) |
| 40–41 | `ROUTER_EMBEDDING_NAME_BY_NAME` / `ROUTER_EMBEDDING_NAME_BY_ID` | `ROUTER_EMBEDDING_NAME_CATALOG` | `init_embedding_name_catalog` | catalog | resolution | Graph-scoped embedding name ↔ **`EmbeddingNameId`** per `GraphId` ([ADR 0031](../adr/0031-vertex-embedding-store-and-derived-vector-index.md) Slice 3). The Router is the sole allocator; vector-index registration interns **by name** so the stored id is exactly the one the graph stamps on canonical embedding writes. Purged with the graph on `unregister_graph` |
| 42 | `ROUTER_VECTOR_INDEXES` | `ROUTER_VECTOR_INDEXES` | `init_vector_indexes` | catalog | derived vector index catalog | **`(GraphId, index_id) → VectorIndexDefStableRecord::V1(VectorIndexDefRecord { index_id, embedding_name_id, kind, metric, encoding, dims, target: Option<VectorIndexTarget { canister }>, activation_state: VectorIndexActivationState { Registered \| DispatchBlockedMissingIncarnationFence \| DispatchEnabled } })`** — derived vector-index definitions (ADR 0031 Slice 3). Versioned envelope (ADR 0007). **Fail-closed activation gate:** `DispatchEnabled` is unreachable while `incarnation_fencing_enabled()` is `const false`, so a targeted definition terminates at `DispatchBlockedMissingIncarnationFence` and the Router never emits a non-empty ephemeral embedding catalog. The single `target` is inspect-only metadata in Slice 3 (never pushed to graph shards). Purged with the graph on `unregister_graph` |

## Graph-vector-index canister — stable regions

New in ADR 0031 Slice 2. **11 regions (MemoryId 0–10).** The entire derived state is rebuildable
from canonical graph embeddings via `vertex_embedding_backfill`, so every derived region shares the
`"vertex_embedding_backfill"` rebuild path in `VECTOR_INDEX_STABLE_LAYOUT`
(`crates/graph-kernel/src/stable_layout.rs`). Code source of truth for runtime `MemoryId` constants:
`crates/graph-vector-index/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`. The degenerate `ivf_flat` foundation runs
with `nlist = 1` / `partition_id = 0` and no centroids; MemoryId 6 (`IVF_CENTROIDS`) is allocated but
empty so Slice 4 can populate centroid bytes without a `MemoryId` repack.

Metadata ownership split: `VECTOR_INDEX_DEFS` (MemoryId 4) is authoritative for per-index config
(`kind`, `encoding`, `dims`, `metric`, `active_index_version`, `stride_bytes`, page-capacity
contract, and the durable `next_vector_id` allocator); `IVF_CENTROID_META` (MemoryId 5) holds only
centroid-specific derived state. The durable `next_page_id` allocator lives in each
`PartitionHead` (MemoryId 9).
