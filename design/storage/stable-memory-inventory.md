Layout change policy: [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-stable-memory-layout.md).
Planned production compatibility and migration policy: [ADR 0039](../adr/0039-production-stable-memory-evolution-and-upgrade-safety.md).

## Purpose

Single inventory of stable-memory regions and heap-only facade state for the graph, router, graph-index, and graph-vector-index canisters. Each row names the owning domain, classification, and rebuild path where one exists.

Code source of truth for runtime `MemoryId` constants:

- `crates/graph/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`
- `crates/router/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`
- `crates/graph-index/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`
- `crates/graph-vector-index/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`

Typed layout registry (descriptive mirror + validation tests): `gleaph_graph_kernel::stable_layout`
and per-canister `facade/stable/layout.rs` — [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-stable-memory-layout.md) §7.

Thread-local pairing: `facade/stable.rs` in each crate.

### Region-count doc-sync checklist

Region counts and per-region classes in this document mirror the typed registry, which is the
mechanical source of truth. The registry tests enforce the counts below; when they change, update
this document and [ADR 0007](../adr/0007-stable-memory-layout.md) in the same patch:

| Canister | Regions | Id range | Registry constant + test |
|----------|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| Graph | 47 | 0–46 | `GRAPH_STABLE_LAYOUT` — `graph_layout_registry_matches_baseline` |
| Router | 49 | 0–48 | `ROUTER_STABLE_LAYOUT` — `router_layout_registry_matches_baseline` |
| Graph-index | 7 | 0–6 | `INDEX_STABLE_LAYOUT` — `index_layout_registry_matches_baseline` |
| Graph-vector-index | 15 | 0–14 | `VECTOR_INDEX_STABLE_LAYOUT` — `vector_index_layout_registry_matches_baseline` |
| Provision | 12 | 0–11 | `PROVISION_STABLE_LAYOUT` — `provision_layout_registry_matches_baseline` |

The canonical/derived split for the router registry projections is pinned by
`router_registry_canonical_derived_split_matches_inventory`.

## Classifications

Authoritative definitions and Gleaph examples: `gleaph_graph_kernel::stable_layout::StableMemoryClass`
(rustdoc on each variant). Per-region class and functional role: `GRAPH_STABLE_LAYOUT`,
`ROUTER_STABLE_LAYOUT`, `INDEX_STABLE_LAYOUT`.

| Class | Meaning | Examples in this repo |
|-------|---------|------------------------|
| `canonical` | Authoritative facts; system meaning does not depend on derived stores | Forward LARA CSR/payloads; vertex/edge properties; router registry and catalogs; mutation idempotency |
| `derived` | Projection or mirror rebuildable from canonical state | Reverse LARA; edge aliases/equality postings; graph-index postings |
| `maintenance` | Physical or admin bookkeeping; not query truth | LARA free spans; maintenance queue; router backfill cursors |
| `catalog` | Bidirectional name ↔ id maps (`BidirectionalCatalog`) | Router label/property/graph/index-name resolution pairs |
| `telemetry` | Event-sourced label stats and projection adjuncts | Graph label stats delta log; router label stats and `ROUTER_LABEL_STATS_PROJECTION` |
| `compatibility` | Legacy read view; another store owns new writes | *(none — P1 `EDGE_WEIGHT_PROFILES` retired 2026-06-12)* |
| `ephemeral` | Heap-only; no `MemoryId` — **not in layout registry** | Graph `PENDING` queues; router planner catalog |

**Sync co-update:** Some derived stores are updated in the same mutation as their canonical source (no async lag). They still have a separate physical region and are classified `derived`.

**Query semantics when derived state lags:** [derived-state-query-semantics.md](../index/derived-state-query-semantics.md).

## Derived-state rebuild summary

| Derived store | Canonical source | Update path | Rebuild / backfill |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| LARA reverse orientation | Forward edges + payloads | Co-updated on edge insert/delete | **Implemented:** `check_reverse_adjacency` + `rebuild_reverse_adjacency` (`facade/derived_state/reverse_adjacency.rs`). The rebuild is a **differential** per-diverged-key reconcile (ADR 0026), not a full clear-and-rebuild — a full rebuild would reassign reverse slot indices, cascade-invalidating `EDGE_ALIASES` keys + reverse payload sidecars. |
| Edge aliases | Forward/reverse adjacency in `GRAPH` | Sync: `commit_insert_edge_alias` on edge insert | **Implemented:** `check_edge_aliases` + `rebuild_edge_aliases` (`facade/derived_state/edge_alias.rs`) |
| Edge property postings (graph-index) | `EDGE_PROPERTIES` (registered props) | DML + `edge_pending` flush | **Implemented:** `backfill_edge_property_postings` + router `admin_edge_backfill_step` ([ADR 0009](../adr/0009-edge-property-index-and-index-ddl.md); retired shard-local `EDGE_EQUALITY_POSTINGS` 2026-06-12) |
| Vertex property postings (graph-index) | Vertex properties (indexable) | DML + `pending.rs` flush | **Implemented:** `backfill_vertex_property_postings` + router `admin_vertex_property_backfill_step` |
| Label postings (graph-index) | `VertexLabelStore` | DML + `label_pending` flush | **Implemented:** `backfill_label_postings` + router `admin_label_backfill_step` ([label-index.md](../index/label-index.md)) |
| Vector-index entries (graph-vector-index) | `VERTEX_EMBEDDINGS` + `VERTEX_EMBEDDING_INCARNATIONS` (canonical embeddings + incarnation fence) | DML + `vector_pending` flush | **Slice 4:** dispatch activated behind the incarnation fence + Router stable flag; **Slice 5:** bounded `admin_vector_index_backfill_step` driver (router → `graph_client::backfill_vertex_embeddings` → graph worker) ([vector-index.md](../index/vector-index.md), [ADR 0031](../adr/0031-vertex-embedding-store-and-derived-vector-index.md)) |
| Router label stats projection | Graph `LabelStatsDelta` | `advance_label_stats_projection` + per-shard cursor | **Implemented:** graph delta log replay via `admin_label_stats_projection_step`; no full historical scan |
| Router indexed-property catalog | Property catalog + planner stats | Planner registration | **Stable** — row layout MemoryId 18–19 |

## Graph canister — LARA bundle

`init_graph()` wires **32** consecutive `MemoryId` regions (0–31) into one `DeferredBidirectionalLabeledLaraGraph`. Thread-local: `GRAPH`.

The Router admin composite query `admin_graph_stable_memory_stats(graph_name)` forwards to each
registered graph shard's guarded `admin_stable_memory_stats` query. The response reports the
logical `VirtualMemory` WebAssembly-page and byte size of all graph-owned regions, including empty
regions, plus the bucket-rounded allocation and slack estimate for each region. The estimate adds
the two-page custom manager metadata area, but the canister's total physical stable-memory usage
is still reported separately by the IC management API / `icp canister status` because that total
also includes other canister memory. The query is observability only and does not expose mutable
storage handles or alter allocation state.

Graph now uses the custom manager from ADR 0043 with a 4-page default; 8 pages for vertex,
label-bucket, label-sidecar, and embedding-incarnation rows; 16 pages for edge slab/log, aliases,
and durable backlog; 32 pages for payload and embeddings; and 64 pages for property and local-unique
values. This is an experimental fresh-layout choice: it keeps small regions below the upstream
128-page default while allowing property-like storage to grow with less extent-count pressure. The custom
manager assigns a bucket size per `MemoryId` while implementing the upstream `ic_stable_structures::Memory` trait.
The first implementation slice is present in `ic-stable-variable-memory-manager`: it persists
per-`MemoryId` policies, allocates append-only variable-sized extents, reconstructs mappings on
reopen, and implements the upstream `ic_stable_structures::Memory` trait. Graph now wires this
manager with an experimental 4/8/16/32/64-page policy; migration and production-capacity validation
remain outstanding. Stable-memory compatibility is not maintained for the current development
layout change; existing development data must be recreated, and production rollout requires the
explicit migration and preflight decision required by ADR 0039.

The manager's global `MAX_EXTENTS = 65,536` currently bounds the all-64-page theoretical
extent-data capacity at 256 GiB; the 500 GiB ICP stable-memory limit is therefore not reachable
by this policy in one MemoryId allocation alone. Capacity planning is shard-local: LARA's two
adjacency orientations, PMA slack, relocation metadata, payloads, and properties share the global
extent budget. The current decision is to retain this extent count and scale out with graph shards;
see [ADR 0043](../adr/0043-per-memory-bucket-size-memory-manager.md#capacity-and-shard-size-decision-2026-07-16).
Capacity-slope benchmarks are in `crates/graph/src/bench/capacity.rs` and are gated behind
`canbench_large`; they cover fixed-width and text properties, distributed and hub-skewed edges,
and delete/reinsert churn. Churn capacity must be evaluated separately from live logical rows
because LARA retains physical free spans for reuse. LARA's labeled PMA benchmark also exposes
The historical quota16/8/4/1 and explicit segment-size comparisons remain recorded in ADR 0001;
the quota Cargo features and production policy variants have been removed. Fresh labeled graphs use
`segment_size = 16` and vertex quota `1`. The tail-headroom
contract derives its boundary from the persisted segment size. The segment16 suite covers
tail-headroom scaling, deferred-maintenance deduplication, and hub/churn across a PMA leaf boundary.
Existing development stable data must be recreated when this policy changes; no compatibility
migration is provided.

Fresh Graph stores use independent initial capacities for the labeled orientations:
`bucket_slots = 1,024`, `edge_slots = 4,096`, and `payload_bytes = 65,536` per orientation.
These are allocation hints only; LARA grows and relocates the slabs as data arrives. Reopen uses
the capacities persisted in each region's own header, so changing these defaults does not resize
existing stable memory.

## Graph canister — facade regions

Repacked 2026-06-11. **Removed:** property name catalog, `VERTEX_LOGICAL_IDS`, federation remote-ref stable (`REMOTE_VERTEX_REFS`, `REMOTE_FORWARD_IN`), `PEER_GRAPH_CANISTERS`. LARA ids are consecutive **0–31**; facade starts at **32**.

| MemoryId | Symbol | Thread-local | Init fn | Class | Owner domain | Rebuild |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------|-------|--------------|---------|
| 32 | `VERTEX_LABEL_SETS` | `VERTEX_LABELS` | `init_vertex_label_store` | canonical | labels | — |
| 33 | `VERTEX_PROPERTIES` | `VERTEX_PROPERTIES` | `init_vertex_property_store` | canonical | properties | — |
| 34 | `EDGE_PROPERTIES` | `EDGE_PROPERTIES` | `init_edge_property_store` | canonical | properties | — |
| 35 | `EDGE_ALIASES` | `EDGE_ALIASES` | `init_edge_alias_index` | derived | adjacency | `check_edge_aliases` / `rebuild_edge_aliases` |
| 36 | `GRAPH_METADATA` | `METADATA` | `init_metadata` | canonical | federation metadata | — |
| 37 | `LABEL_STATS_DELTA_SEQ` | `LABEL_STATS_DELTA_SEQ` | `init_label_stats_delta_seq` | telemetry | label stats projection | Monotonic seq allocator |
| 38 | `LABEL_STATS_DELTA_LOG` | `LABEL_STATS_DELTA_LOG` | `init_label_stats_delta_log` | telemetry | label stats projection | Delta replay to router |
| 39 | `GRAPH_MUTATION_JOURNAL` | `GRAPH_MUTATION_JOURNAL` | `init_graph_mutation_journal` | canonical | idempotency | Mutation outcome + emitted delta seq range. A single-DML mutation is recorded `Completed` even when its index flush is deferred to the repair journal (region 41), since the store mutation + deltas are durable and the index converges async (ADR 0024). Bounded by [ADR 0027](../adr/0027-graph-mutation-journal-retention.md): every entry carries `recorded_at_ns` and is evicted after `GRAPH_MUTATION_JOURNAL_RETENTION_NS` (9d, a lower bound `>=` the router's 7d replay TTL — see region 7) via amortized write-path GC (**B**, heap round-robin cursor) on the completed-journal write. Legacy entries (`recorded_at_ns == None`) are lazy-stamped to "now" on first sweep so the pre-upgrade backlog ages out from upgrade time. Ack-through-seq is **not** used as the eviction trigger (unsound: no-delta mutations, shard-global cursor, ack precedes router completion) |
| 40 | `PENDING_VERTEX_PURGES` | `PENDING_VERTEX_PURGES` | `init_pending_vertex_purges` | maintenance | vertex delete | Tombstoned vertices mid-purge (ADR 0021); insert is fail-closed and runs before the tombstone (a failed insert aborts the delete, never leaving ungated ghost edges); rebuildable by scanning tombstoned vertices with surviving incident edges (no API) |
| 41 | `INDEX_REPAIR_JOURNAL` | `INDEX_REPAIR_JOURNAL` | `init_index_repair_journal` | maintenance | federated index repair | Failed-flush index postings persisted on compensation-success (ADR 0023 D5); re-applied by the maintenance driver each tick and on `post_upgrade`, removed on success. Value type is `RepairJournalEntry { mutation_id, op }` (ADR 0029 Phase 2): each entry carries the originating federated `mutation_id` (`0` = untracked sentinel) so `index_pending_min_mutation_id()` derives the mutation-linked index watermark (smallest unapplied tracked mutation). **Backward-incompatible repack**: the value schema changed in place from a bare `RepairPostingOp` to `RepairJournalEntry`; pre-existing entries in the old layout are not migrated (no production deployment) |
| 42 | `UNIQUE_EFFECT_OUTBOX` | `UNIQUE_EFFECT_OUTBOX` | `init_unique_effect_outbox` | canonical | cross-shard uniqueness | **`EffectId { mutation_id, effect_ordinal } → UniqueEffectReceipt { claim_id?, owner_element_id, constraint_id, encoded_value, op: Acquire \| Release }`** (ADR 0030). Pinned commit evidence: each unique-affecting canonical segment appends one receipt per effect; an effect stays pinned until the Router acks its `EffectId` (per-effect, never unpinning a sibling). Canonical: a `Reserved`-not-yet-committed claim has no receipt, so un-acked-effect *absence* is authoritative proof of non-commit — decoupled from the 9-day journal eviction (region 39 / ADR 0027). Replicated `Acquire`-by-`ClaimId` proof read + per-effect ack are Router-only update endpoints. Append is idempotent across deterministic replays. Emit wiring into the DML segment lands in slice 5 |
| 43 | `GRAPH_LOCAL_UNIQUE_VALUES` | `GRAPH_LOCAL_UNIQUE_VALUES` | `init_graph_local_unique_table` | canonical | shard-local global uniqueness | **`(constraint_id, encoded_value) → LocalUniqueRecord { owner_element_id }`** (ADR 0030 slice 10). Canonical source of truth for `ShardLocalGlobal` unique constraints: a graph proven single-shard at CREATE enforces graph-wide uniqueness entirely in its one owning shard's local table, bypassing the Router reservation/`UNIQUE_EFFECT_OUTBOX` path. The acquire path preflights all claims and inserts them inside the canonical write segment (all-or-nothing); a delete/remove frees the value by owner match; the DROP drain purges the constraint's entries and gates `Removed` on the range being empty. The key omits `graph_id` because one graph canister hosts exactly one graph/shard. No `Acquire`/`Release` receipts and no Router reservations are ever written for these constraints |
| 44 | `VERTEX_EMBEDDINGS` | `VERTEX_EMBEDDINGS` | `init_vertex_embedding_store` | canonical | embeddings | **`(VertexId, EmbeddingNameId) → StoredEmbedding { encoding, dims, version, bytes }`** ([ADR 0031](../adr/0031-vertex-embedding-store-and-derived-vector-index.md)). Canonical fixed-dimension `F32` vertex embeddings owned by the graph shard. Vertex-major, big-endian, fixed-width 6-byte key so vertex delete enumerates a vertex's embeddings via a per-vertex range scan (`commit_clear_vertex_embeddings`). Value is a length-prefixed manual layout led by a `schema_version: u8` tag; an unknown schema/encoding tag traps on read (incompatible layout requires a migration). Source for the derived vector-index backfill (Slice 5); dispatch is activated behind the incarnation fence + Router stable flag (Slice 4) |
| 45 | `VERTEX_EMBEDDING_INCARNATIONS` | (within `init_vertex_embedding_store`) | `init_vertex_embedding_store` | canonical | embeddings | **`(VertexId, EmbeddingNameId) → u64`** ([ADR 0031](../adr/0031-vertex-embedding-store-and-derived-vector-index.md) Slice 4). Delete-spanning, monotonic `embedding_incarnation` high-water mark per embedding identity: it strictly increases on each reinsert and is **never deleted** (a remove keeps the entry while clearing region 44). Shares the `VertexEmbeddingKey` shape with region 44; the live `StoredEmbedding` payload stays incarnation-free. Sync ops carry `embedding_incarnation` so the vector canister orders writes by `(incarnation, version)`, closing the delete/reinsert forward- and reverse-orphan races. `set`/`remove` checked-fail on `IncarnationOverflow` (`u64::MAX` wraparound) |
| 46 | `DERIVED_INDEX_OUTBOX` | `DERIVED_INDEX_OUTBOX` | `init_derived_index_outbox` | maintenance | federated index delivery | **`sequence → DerivedIndexOutboxEntry { mutation_id, op }`** (Plan 0088). Durable FIFO storage and Graph DML handoff for derived property, label, and vector-index work. Maintenance passes the durable suffix to target batch endpoints, which return an acknowledged prefix under their own instruction budget; only that prefix is removed. DML-only ad-hoc/native blocks use the outbox, while DML followed by an in-block read retains the legacy flush boundary. |

Graph facade **15 regions** total (32 LARA + 15 facade). `DERIVED_INDEX_OUTBOX` (MemoryId 46) is the durable FIFO handoff for successful Graph DML; target batch endpoints determine the safe progress prefix and the shared dispatcher removes only acknowledged entries. DML-only ad-hoc/native blocks use the outbox; blocks that read after DML retain a legacy flush boundary for read-after-write visibility. Retired 2026-06-12: `EDGE_PAYLOAD_PROFILES` → router SSOT ([ADR 0008](../adr/0008-edge-inline-value-profile-router-ssot.md)); `EDGE_EQUALITY_POSTINGS` → graph-index ([ADR 0009](../adr/0009-edge-property-index-and-index-ddl.md)).

Property **names** are router-owned (`ROUTER_PROPERTY_CATALOG`); graph stores values by `PropertyId` only.

## Router canister — stable regions

Repacked 2026-06-17: placement removed, controllers merged into auth, MemoryIds compacted to **0–33** (34 regions). ADR 0030 appended the uniqueness constraint catalog (**34–36**), the uniqueness reservation table (**37**), and the slice-6 reservation reverse index (**38**) and pending unique-effect discovery index (**39**), bringing the total to 40 regions (0–39). ADR 0031 Slice 3 appended the graph-scoped embedding-name catalog (**40–41**) and the derived vector-index definition catalog (**42**), and Slice 4 appended the vector dispatch activation flag (**43**), and Slice 10 appended the vector maintenance policy catalog (**44**), bringing the total to **45 regions (0–44)**. Regions grouped **auth → registry → runtime config → idempotency → catalog → telemetry → maintenance → constraint catalog → reservation table → reservation reverse index → pending-effect discovery → embedding-name catalog → vector-index catalog → vector dispatch activation → vector maintenance policy**. `ROUTER_GRAPHS` keyed by **`GraphId`**; `ShardRegistryEntry` stores **`graph_id: GraphId`**. `ROUTER_SHARDS` keyed by **`GraphShardKey { graph_id, shard_id }`**; `ROUTER_SHARD_BY_GRAPH` is **`Principal → GraphShardKey`**; shard listing per logical graph uses **`ROUTER_SHARDS_BY_GRAPH_ID`**.

### Registry denormalization invariants (implemented 2026-06-17)

Regions **1–2** (canonical), **3–4** (derived indexes), **`ROUTER_GRAPH_RUNTIME_CONFIG` (5)**, plus **`ROUTER_GRAPH_CATALOG` (15–16)** form an intentional denormalized lookup set — not a merge candidate. Federation dispatch depends on all six staying synchronized at each registry **commit** boundary.

**Commit APIs** (`RouterStore::commit_register_graph`, `commit_register_shard`, `commit_unregister_shard` in `crates/router/src/facade/store/registry.rs`) update the affected regions atomically from the domain owner's perspective. **`commit_register_shard`** requires a matching `ROUTER_GRAPHS` entry (not catalog-only). **`check_registry_invariants`** (`registry_invariants.rs`) verifies full bidirectional consistency; unit tests call it after every registry mutation. Per-commit verification is disabled in production for cost (`verify_registry_invariants_after_commit` is a no-op outside tests), so the same read-only oracle is also exposed as the admin query **`admin_check_registry_invariants`** (`Role::Admin`) — used to confirm registry consistency on demand, including across a canister upgrade (the router has no upgrade hook and relies on stable memory surviving the reinstall). E2E coverage: `pocket-ic-tests/tests/router_registry_invariants.rs`. **`list_shards_for_graph_id`** / **`list_shards_for_graph`** walk `ROUTER_SHARDS_BY_GRAPH_ID` only (O(shards for graph)), hydrate **`Vec<ShardRegistryEntry>`** from `ROUTER_SHARDS`, and reject duplicate index ids and stale index→primary references; they do not full-scan `ROUTER_SHARDS` — missing index rows are caught on commit / by `check_registry_invariants`.

Versioned envelope (ADR 0030 Revision #18, Slice 9): the DROP lifecycle adds `state`/`dropping_at_ns`/`drop_scan_generation`; `Removed` is the terminal **absence** of the record (deleted by recovery once the completion gate holds), not a persisted enum value |

Registered before the first dispatch `await` for any dispatch that may emit a unique `Acquire`/`Release`, so it co-commits with the reservation/envelope. The pinned `canister` is the row's immutable identity, stored verbatim (not re-derived from the shard registry) so recovery reaches the exact canister even after the shard is unregistered/reused; `register` is **fail-closed** (re-registering the same key to a different canister traps). `client_key` is the owning `ClientMutationKey`, stored so Driver 2 resolves the `RouterMutationRecord` (its terminal-completion proof) for **any** effect kind — a `Release` or orphan `Acquire` owns no reservation, so the reverse index (region 38) cannot resolve them; the row GC-pins that record while it exists. Driver 2 only drains a row once its mutation is terminal, classifies a reservation-less `Acquire` as an orphan only then, and removes the row only after a fresh `cursor=None` re-scan is empty. This is the only handle to an orphan `Acquire` whose reservation is gone (parked `Quarantined` on a long backoff, never acked). The value is a **versioned record** so the diagnostic/quarantine/backoff fields evolve without a breaking value-layout change. While any row remains the owning `RouterMutationRecord` is **GC-pinned** (Driver 2 reads its completion state); a row is removed only after the shard re-enumerates the mutation's effects empty (all acked) |

Versioned envelope (ADR 0007). The stored `activation_state` is `Registered`/`DispatchBlocked`; **`DispatchEnabled` is derived at read time** by `graph_vector_dispatch_ready(graph_id)` (Slice 4 two-condition gate: global flag region 43 **AND** every live shard vector-attached to the graph's single target). The Router emits a non-empty ephemeral embedding catalog only when ready (fail-closed otherwise). Registration enforces **one index per embedding name per graph** and **one target per graph**.

Set by `admin_set_vector_dispatch_activation` / read by `vector_dispatch_activation_enabled` (RBAC admin). Replaces the retired `const fn incarnation_fencing_enabled()`. Necessary but not sufficient: per-graph emission is additionally fenced on every live shard's `vector_index_attached` bit. Reversible without a redeploy |

Versioned envelope (ADR 0007), **default absent/disabled** (the push step is a no-op until set + enabled). Authorship is `authorize_index_ddl` (validated: `recommended_*_bps <= required_*_bps`, nonzero budgets, def exists); `admin_vector_maintenance_step` snapshots it and forwards one bounded unit to the vector canister (which owns the execution state).

Router **49 regions** total (0–48).

Router uses `ic-stable-variable-memory-manager` with the same shared-capacity, append-only
extent model as Graph. The initial policy is intentionally asymmetric: the default is 2 pages;
single-cell control state uses 1 page; name catalogs and sparse maintenance state use 2 pages;
ordinary registry/telemetry/catalog rows use 4–8 pages; and bursty mutation, prepared-query,
reservation, pending-effect, and provisioning request rows use 16 pages. These values are a
capacity/slack hypothesis to validate with Router canbench and stable-memory measurements, not a
claim that every region should retain its current quantum. The development layout is deliberately
incompatible with the prior upstream `MemoryManager` format; no compatibility reader is provided.
The Router stable-layout canbench touches all 49 regions; its persisted baseline therefore includes
the constraint, vector, and provisioning groups rather than only the original registry/catalog set.
Capacity probes currently measure a 2-page property catalog at 1,024 rows and a 16-page prepared
plan catalog at 32 × 256 KiB. They are growth-slope guards; they do not establish the maximum
cardinality of an unbounded catalog or replace canister-level stable-memory monitoring.

## Graph-vector-index canister — stable regions

New in ADR 0031 Slice 2; extended in Slice 6 and Slice 7; physical page store replaced by ADR 0032; maintenance scan state added in Slice 10. **15 regions (MemoryId 0–14).** The entire derived
state is rebuildable from canonical graph embeddings via `vertex_embedding_backfill`, so every
derived region shares the `"vertex_embedding_backfill"` rebuild path in `VECTOR_INDEX_STABLE_LAYOUT`
(`crates/graph-kernel/src/stable_layout.rs`). Code source of truth for runtime `MemoryId` constants:
`crates/graph-vector-index/src/facade/stable/memory.rs`. The degenerate `ivf_flat` foundation runs
with `nlist = 1` / `partition_id = 0` and no centroids; MemoryId 6 (`IVF_CENTROIDS`) is allocated but
empty so Slice 4 can populate centroid bytes without a `MemoryId` repack.

Metadata ownership split: `VECTOR_INDEX_DEFS` (MemoryId 4) is authoritative for per-index config
(`kind`, `encoding`, `dims`, `metric`, `active_index_version`, `stride_bytes`, page-capacity
contract, and the durable `next_vector_id` allocator); `IVF_CENTROID_META` (MemoryId 5) holds only
centroid-specific derived state. The durable `next_page_id` allocator lives in each
`PartitionHead` (MemoryId 9).

Slice 6 adds `VECTOR_ID_TO_SUBJECT` (MemoryId 11): a `(index_id, vector_id) → VectorSubject`
reverse locator used by the partition-page search path to resolve a scanned page row back to its
subject. It is maintained in lockstep with `VECTOR_ID_TO_SLOT` on insert/resurrect/remove and is a
pure locator — `VECTOR_SUBJECT_TO_ID` (MemoryId 7) remains the single source of truth for
liveness/freshness (the row is only scored after re-validating the subject entry's `vector_id`,
`slot`, and `generation`).

Slice 7 adds `VECTOR_REBUILD_STATE` (MemoryId 12): a `index_id → VectorRebuildStateRecord` holding
the per-index bounded shadow-version rebuild lifecycle (`Idle`/`Sampling`/`Training`/`Building`/
`ReadyToPublish`/`Cleaning`/`Aborting`/`Failed`), each long-running phase carrying a resume cursor so
admin steps stay bounded. The `Sampling` and `Training` variants additionally carry the bounded
distinct candidate pool (Slice 8 k-means-lite training); it stays inside this MemoryId 12 record and is
not split into a separate region (ADR 0033). The value is persisted as `RawRebuildState` — the verbatim
`VectorRebuildStateRecord` Candid bytes (on-disk format unchanged) — so the per-step fail-closed
encoded-size guard and the persist share a single Candid encode instead of encoding twice. It is derived (reconstructible by re-running a rebuild from the active
version) and shares the `vertex_embedding_backfill` rebuild path. Slice 7 also extends the
`VECTOR_SUBJECT_TO_ID` value (`SubjectMapEntry`) with a second `shadow_slot: Option<SlotRef>`
(serde-default, no repack) so an atomic publish stays metadata-only; search resolves the live slot
via `current_slot_for(active_index_version)`.

ADR 0032 replaces the MemoryId 10 large-value page store with a composite slab page store: MemoryId
10 becomes `VECTOR_PAGE_META` (a `(index_id, version, partition_id, page_id) → VectorPageMeta`
directory of `{ slab_offset, capacity, row_count, live_count, row_stride, tombstone_count }`), and a
new MemoryId 13 `VECTOR_ROW_SLAB` holds the raw structure-of-arrays row bytes behind a magic/version
header. The two regions form one composite store (`PAGE_STORE`) that opens together and fails closed
on a partial layout (see [ADR 0032](../adr/0032-vector-index-slab-page-store.md)). This is a **fresh
layout cutover** with no deployed `VECTOR_PAGE` state, no migration, and no compatibility reader; the
`vertex_embedding_backfill` rebuild path is the canonical-embedding reconstruction route, not a
page-format migration. Each row carries a derived `subject_locator` that retires
`VECTOR_ID_TO_SUBJECT` from the partition-scan hot path while `VECTOR_SUBJECT_TO_ID` stays the
freshness source of truth. `VECTOR_PARTITION_HEADS` (MemoryId 9) remains the per-partition
allocator/counter owner and is deliberately outside the composite store.

A derived, router-guarded admin query (`admin_vector_slab_stats`) reports slab-space observability
over these two regions: whole-slab physical facts (size, `occupied_tail`, global referenced bytes,
conservative dead-space estimate) plus optional per-`index_id`/per-version logical counters. Because
`VECTOR_ROW_SLAB` is a single global allocation domain, the physical facts are always global while
`index_id` scopes only the logical counters. It reads only `VECTOR_PAGE_META` + the slab header
(never row bytes or `VECTOR_SUBJECT_TO_ID`). `admin_vector_slab_stats` is the **unbounded** full
page-meta scan kept as a convenience query; `admin_vector_slab_stats_step` is the IC-safe bounded
companion that scans at most `max_pages` page-meta entries per call and returns an opaque `PageKey`
cursor. Its steps are additive partials merged client-side: each step still sums global referenced
bytes across the whole map (even under an `index_id` filter), so the per-step dead-space estimate is
`0` and is recomputed once after merging. A malformed step cursor returns an error rather than
trapping. The stepped path is a bounded best-effort scan with **no snapshot isolation** (the cursor
is only a `PageKey`, so concurrent `VECTOR_PAGE_META` writes between calls can be missed or
double-counted); run it during a quiescent window or use the single-call query for an exact figure.
Both queries are diagnostic only and never affect search/freshness; allocator/compaction work remains
deferred.

## Provision canister — stable regions

New in ADR 0035 Slice 2. **11 regions (MemoryId 0–10).** Code source of truth for runtime `MemoryId`
constants: `crates/provision/src/stable/memory.rs`. Typed registry and rebuild path:
`PROVISION_STABLE_LAYOUT` in `crates/graph-kernel/src/stable_layout.rs`. Region 2 is a derived
secondary index and is commit-synced with Region 1 (`PROVISION_JOB_BY_REQUEST`).
